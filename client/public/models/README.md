## 🚀 Quick Start Example

Let's add a lamp model:

1. Go to **Sketchfab.com**
2. Search: **"low poly lamp glb"**
3. Find a free model and download it (GLB format)
4. Rename it to: `light.aurora-bar.glb` (or `lamp.ready-set.glb`)
5. Place it in this folder: `client/public/models/`
6. Done! The model will appear in your 3D room

## ✅ Step-by-Step Process

1. **Download** a GLB model from Sketchfab/Poly Haven/etc.
2. **Rename** it to match one of the SKUs above (e.g., `light.aurora-bar.glb`)
3. **Place** it in: `client/public/models/`
4. **Restart** your dev server (if needed)
5. **Test** by placing the item in your 3D room

## 💡 Tips

- **Start with 1-2 models** to test, then add more
- **Low-poly models** work best (under 5000 triangles)
- **GLB format** is preferred (single file, includes textures)
- **File names must match exactly** (case-sensitive!)
- **No models?** The app uses fallback shapes (cylinders, boxes) so it works without models!

## 🎨 Model Recommendations

For each item type, search for:
- **Poster**: "low poly poster" or "wall art glb"
- **Lamp/Light**: "low poly lamp" or "desk lamp glb"
- **Plant**: "low poly plant" or "potted plant glb"
- **Shelf**: "low poly shelf" or "floating shelf glb"
- **Sofa**: "low poly sofa" or "loveseat glb"
- **Table**: "low poly table" or "side table glb"
- **Mat**: "low poly mat" or "yoga mat glb" (optional - floor items are less visible)
